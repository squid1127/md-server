# md-server

A tiny markdown preview server for your services.

## Branch: rev2

This is a complete rewrite of the original `md-server`, using an actual web framework and revised backend logic. The original version is still available in the `rev1` branch (maybe).

## Maintenance

This project is currently maintained by [squid1127](https://github.com/squid1127), although not very well (I suck at frontend lol ~ squid). Feel free to open issues or PRs.

## Features

[TBD]
